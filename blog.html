            <h2 class="blog-question">What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">DOM stands for Document Object Model, which is a programming interface for web documents. When a web page is loaded into a web browser, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page, which is essentially a tree-like structure that represents the page's HTML elements and their relationships to each other. The DOM also includes information about the content, styling, and behavior of the web page. The purpose of the DOM is to enable developers to interact with web pages. DOM provides a powerful way for developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages and it has become a fundamental technology for building modern web applications.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-question">How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">To select HTML elements using DOM, we can use tag name, id or class name with the help of DOM methods. Here are some of the most commonly used methods for selecting HTML elements using DOM: <br>

                1. getElementById(): This method selects an HTML element based on its ID attribute. <br>
                
                2. getElementsByClassName(): This method selects HTML elements based on their class name. <br> 
                
                3. getElementsByTagName(): This method selects HTML elements based on their tag name.  <br>
                
                4. querySelector(): This method selects the first HTML element that matches a specified CSS selector. <br> 
                
                5. querySelectorAll(): This method selects all HTML elements that match a specified CSS selector. <br> etc.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-question">What is event bubble?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event and that event bubbles up to its parent elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element. Event bubbling can be useful for creating more flexible and dynamic user interfaces, but it can also lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.</p>

            <h2 class="blog-question">What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h2>
            <p class="blog-answer">Callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, which is then called inside the receiving function. The purpose of the callback function is to execute a function only after another function has completed its execution.</p>
